# Agda MCP Server

A [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that provides interactive Agda development capabilities. This enables AI-assisted proof development, interactive theorem proving, and exploration of Agda code through a standardized protocol.

## Features

- **Persistent REPL Session**: Maintains Agda interaction state across commands, preserving goals, context, and type-checking results
- **24 Interactive Commands**: Comprehensive coverage of Agda interaction operations including proof search, case splitting, and module exploration
- **Automatic File Persistence**: Commands that modify code (give, refine, case split, auto) automatically persist changes to disk
- **HTTP Transport**: Standards-compliant MCP server with HTTP/JSON-RPC transport
- **Type-Safe Integration**: Built with Haskell's type system for robust MCP protocol handling
- **Smart Response Formatting**: Concise human-readable output by default (~90% size reduction), with optional full JSON mode

## Architecture

The server runs a persistent Agda REPL in a background thread, communicating via channels:
- Commands are sent through a `Chan CommandWithResponse`
- Responses are routed back via `MVar Response`
- Each MCP tool call is converted to an `IOTCM` command and executed in the persistent REPL
- Goals, context, and interaction state persist between commands

### File Edit Persistence

When commands modify Agda code, changes are automatically persisted to disk:
- **Response capture**: The REPL callback intercepts typed `Response` values (e.g., `Resp_GiveAction`, `Resp_MakeCase`)
- **Monadic**: Edit operations are in the TCM monad context using Agda's native APIs
- **Type-specific strategies**: Different edit types for different operations:
  - `ReplaceHole`: In-place hole filling (give, refine, auto)
  - `ReplaceLine`: Structural edits with line insertion (case split)
  - `BatchEdits`: Multiple operations applied in reverse position order (auto_all)
- **Position-aware**: Edits preserve file structure and handle position invalidation correctly

This architecture ensures that operations like "load file" → "get goals" → "give solution" not only update the REPL state but also persist the changes to the source file.

## Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) with flakes enabled
- [Agda](https://agda.readthedocs.io/) (automatically provided by Nix environment)
- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) or another MCP client

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/faezs/agda-mcp.git
cd agda-mcp
```

2. Enter the Nix development shell:
```bash
nix develop
```

3. Build the server:
```bash
cabal build
```

4. Run the server:
```bash
cabal run agda-mcp
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:3000/mcp` by default.

## Building without Nix (this fork)

This fork adds a plain-`cabal` build so no Nix is required:

- `mcp-server` (which is not on Hackage) is vendored under `vendor/mcp-server/`
  at the commit upstream's flake pinned (`drshade/haskell-mcp-server@92c70a9`)
  with `patches/mcp-server-header-optional.patch` already applied.
- `cabal.project` wires that in and pins `Agda ==2.8.0` from Hackage. The build
  needs **GHC 9.10** (mcp-server requires `base >= 4.20`); install it with
  `ghcup install ghc 9.10.2`.

```sh
cabal build exe:agda-mcp
cabal run  exe:agda-mcp          # serves http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

The listening port is configurable via `AGDA_MCP_PORT` (upstream hardcodes 3000),
so a pool of instances can run — one per parallel worker — for isolation without
relying on the client passing a `sessionId`:

```sh
AGDA_DIR=/path/to/agdadir ./scripts/serve-pool.sh 4   # ports 3000..3003
```

Point the Agda's library search at your project's dependencies by setting
`AGDA_DIR` to a directory containing `libraries` and `defaults`.

## Configuration

### Claude Code

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration file (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agda-mcp": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "command": "cabal",
      "args": ["run", "agda-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/agda-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

The server implements MCP protocol version 2025-06-18 with HTTP transport. Configure your client to:
- Connect to: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- Use JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP POST
- Include `Content-Type: application/json` header
- Optionally include `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18` header

## Available Tools

## Available Resources

Resources expose Agda information as readable data sources. They use URI-based routing.

### 1. `Goals`

**URI Pattern:** `resource://goals/{file}`

List all goals in the specified Agda file.

### 2. `GoalInfo`

**URI Pattern:** `resource://goal_info/{file}/{id}`

Detailed information about a specific goal, including its type, context, and location.

### 3. `FileContext`

**URI Pattern:** `resource://file_context/{file}`

Overall context and scope information for an Agda file.

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start the server
cabal run agda-mcp

# 2. In Claude Code, load an Agda file
/mcp agda-mcp agda_load file="/path/to/Example.agda"

# 3. Get all goals in the file
/mcp agda-mcp agda_get_goals
# Output: 5 goals: ?0:Nat(10:12) ?1:Nat(11:12) ?2:Nat(15:12) ?3:Nat(16:12) ?4:A(20:18)

# 4. Check the type of goal 0
/mcp agda-mcp agda_get_goal_type goalId=0
# Output: ?0 : Nat

# 5. See available variables
/mcp agda-mcp agda_get_context goalId=0
# Output: Context:
#   n : Nat

# 6. Fill the goal - FILE IS AUTOMATICALLY EDITED
/mcp agda-mcp agda_give goalId=0 expression="n"
# ✓ Filled ?0 with 'n'
# File now shows: zero + n = n

# 7. Case split on a variable - FILE IS AUTOMATICALLY EDITED
/mcp agda-mcp agda_case_split goalId=1 variable="m"
# Split ?1 into 2 clauses:
#   suc zero + n = {! !}
#   suc (suc m) + n = {! !}
# File now has 2 lines instead of 1

# 8. Reload to see new goals after case split
/mcp agda-mcp agda_load file="/path/to/Example.agda"
/mcp agda-mcp agda_get_goals
# Now shows updated goal structure
```

### File Persistence in Action

When you use commands like `agda_give`, `agda_refine`, or `agda_case_split`:
1. ✅ The command executes in the REPL
2. ✅ The response is captured before JSON encoding
3. ✅ **File edits are extracted and applied automatically**
4. ✅ The JSON response is returned to the LLM
5. ✅ Changes are persisted to disk immediately

**No manual file editing needed!** The MCP server handles all source modifications.

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

**Issue:** Port 3000 already in use
```
bind: address already in use (Address already in use)
```

**Solution:** Kill existing process or change port (currently hardcoded to 3000).

### Connection Refused from Claude Code

**Issue:** `Failed to reconnect to agda-mcp`

**Possible Causes:**
1. Server not running: Start with `cabal run agda-mcp`
2. Wrong configuration: Verify MCP config file
3. Network issues: Check that localhost:3000 is accessible

### Goals Not Persisting

**Issue:** Goals disappear after loading file

**Solution:** This should not happen with the persistent REPL architecture. If it does:
1. Check server logs for errors
2. Verify the file loaded successfully with `agda_load`
3. Check that the REPL thread is running (look for "Starting persistent Agda REPL thread..." in logs)

### Type Checking Errors

**Issue:** Agda reports type errors or missing modules

**Solution:**
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Check that your Agda library path is correctly configured
3. Load the file first with `agda_load` before other operations

## mcp-server Patch

This project includes a patch to the `mcp-server` Haskell library (version 0.1.0.15) to improve compatibility with MCP clients that don't send the `MCP-Protocol-Version` HTTP header.

**What the patch does:**
- Makes the `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18` HTTP header optional
- Falls back to protocol version negotiation during the `initialize` handshake
- Logs warnings when header is missing but continues processing

**Why it's needed:**
Claude Code's HTTP transport (as of version 2.0.13) sends the protocol version in the `initialize` JSON-RPC message but not as an HTTP header. The mcp-server 0.1.0.15 strictly requires the header per MCP spec 2025-06-18, causing connection failures.

**Patch location:** `patches/mcp-server-header-optional.patch`

This patch is applied automatically during the Nix build process via `pkgs.applyPatches` in `flake.nix`.

## Technical Details

### File Edit Implementation

The file persistence feature is implemented with structural awareness:

**Three Edit Types:**
1. **ReplaceHole** (Give, Refine, Auto): In-place replacement of `{! expr !}` with new text
   - Removes or keeps braces depending on `GiveResult` type
   - Preserves surrounding code structure

2. **ReplaceLine** (Case Split): Structural line replacement
   - Deletes the line containing the goal
   - Inserts N new clauses with preserved indentation
   - Handles both function and extended lambda cases

3. **BatchEdits** (SolveAll): Multiple hole fills
   - Applies edits in **reverse position order** (bottom-to-top)
   - Prevents position invalidation from earlier edits
   - Each solution extracted from concrete `Expr`

**Position Safety:**
- Uses Agda's `Range` type for precise positions (1-indexed line/col)
- Leverages `getInteractionRange :: InteractionId -> TCM Range`
- Sorts batch edits by position to avoid coordinate shifts

**TCM Context Extraction:**
- Works with typed `Response` values before JSON encoding
- No JSON parsing needed - uses native Agda types
- Runs in the same TCM monad as Agda interaction
